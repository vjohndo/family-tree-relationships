# Shippit backend challenge

Initial commit

Model Assumptions:
- Single partnership only. I.e. can not repartner and have children
- No half-siblings
- Gender can not be changed
- No Spaces in names

To Dos:
- Refactor error handling
- Need to handle null cases for each relationship
- Simplify error handling... If such a relationship does not exist return NONE.
- No Further Partnerings can only get relationship and add to existing family
